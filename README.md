# CastleTrivia
CastleTrivia is a trivia game with a short horror story. Made with Ren'Py.

The source code is available for Ren'Py developers who are interested in using a **multiple-choice quiz system** for their games. The implementation here is  very basic, but I hope you will it find useful.

The prototype version contains only ten questions, but that can be changed through "questions.rpy". 

The difficulty of the quiz can also be modified by increasing or decreasing the amount of wrong answers allowed in "script.rpy".

## Other Features

If you want to **change the main menu** of your game depending on the ending, you can find my implementation here as well. Please check "screen.rpy" and "script.rpy" for details.

The game also uses a **"speech box" dialogue style** aside from the traditional layout of a visual novel. Please check "gui.rpy" and "script.rpy" for details. Additionally, custom graphic files under the gui folder ("textbox_frame.png") may be required.
